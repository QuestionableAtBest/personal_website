                <b>Hello World!</b> Is what I would say if I were a computer but I'm not. At least I don't <em>think</em> I am. My name is Harry and I'm
                attending BCIT in the Computer Information Technology Program. I hope to one day work in the technology field
                as a systems engineer or a software developer. 
                I graduated highschool knowing I absolutely <em><strong>hated</strong></em> doing acting and the arts,
                so I hoped to do something in the sciences. I landed in tech as it was a general interest of mine and I <em>hope</em> that it pays off in the end.
                In my spare time I enjoy talking with friends, playing video games and browsing the web. Let's have a good year together!
